This language is going to need a name.  Some possible names, along
with their benefits, drawbacks, and possible file extensions:

* **SilverAbella** or **Silverabella**
  + Pros:  This is a very obvious name, combining the names of the two
    languages it pulls from.
  + Cons:  It is a bit too obvious, and uncreative.
  + File Extension:  `.svthm`
* **AbellaSilver** or **Abellasilver**
  + Pros:  This is also a very obvious name, combining the two.
  + Cons:  It is also too obvious and uncreative, with the added
    problem that it doesn't sound as good as SilverAbella.
  + File Extension:  `.thmsv`
* **Gold**
  + Pros:  This is the next obvious progression in the MELT group,
    since gold is below copper and silver on the periodic table.
  + Cons:  With the connotations of being the best, using this name
    sounds a bit egotistical.  It also gives no description of what
    the language's purpose is.
  + File Extension:  `.au`, `.gold`
* *Any other metal*
  + Pros:  Another metal would fit with the MELT naming scheme,
    without the egotistical connotation of gold (other than, perhaps,
    platinum).
  + Cons:  Such a name would give no description of what the
    language's purpose is.
  + File Extension:  Periodic table symbol
* **Extensibella** or **Extensabella**
  + Pros:  This name describes what the language is, in that it is
    extensible and based on Abella.
  + Cons:  This doesn't say anything about attribute grammars or
    Silver.
  + File Extension:  `.xthm`
* **ExtensibellAG** or **ExtensabellAG**
  + Pros:  As with Extensibella, this describes what the language is,
    including the attribute grammar part.
  + Cons:  This is more awkward than Extensibella.
  + File Extension:  `.agthm`, `.thmag`
