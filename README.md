# Abella-AG-Interface

The purpose of this project is to provide an encoding to reason about
Silver specifications in Abella, with an interface for the user to
interact with to do proofs.  This interface hides the details of the
encoding so the user sees attribute-grammar-type code, not the
encoding.
